Defensive programming:
    docstring = specifications for functions
    modularize = split program in functions
    check conditions on input/output

Testing/Validation:
    prepare input and output to check program
    how can i break my program

Debugging:
    which events leads to the error
    why is not working?
    how can i fix it?

Setup for testing and debugging:
    break program into modules
    document constraints = docstring on modules

Testing:
    ensure code runs
    expected result to some inputs

    types:
        unit testing
        regression testing = check previous bugs in the same function
        integration testing = whole program
